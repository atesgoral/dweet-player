# dweet player

Allows you to make multi-part demos out of [dweets](https://www.dwitter.net).

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8787

## Usage

### Demo encoding

Demos are encoded in the URL with the following structure:

`/demo/v1/<loader dweet ID>/<timeline>/<audio track URL>`

Where:

- **loader dweet ID** is the dweet to use as a loader. If you don't want to specify one, use "*" to randomly pick one from a pool. Loader dweets should complete their progress animation when t reaches 1.
- **timeline** An array of scenes. Each scene is a dweet ID + some effects. More on this below.
- **audio track URL** - Full URL of an audio track. Currently, only direct MP3 URLs are supported.

The timeline string is a comma-separated list of scenes: `<scene 1>,<scene 2>,...`.

Each scene starts with a dweet ID, followed by a combination of these optional components:
- A duration specifier
- A time warping specifier
- A trigonometric function (sine, cosine, tangent) morphing specifier
- A "blender" (bad name for what it actually does)
- A "=" at the very end to make the scene contiguous with a prior appearance of the same dweet i.e. dweet frame/t values continue increasing. By default, each dweet's runtime is reset every time they're shown.

Duration specifiers can be:
- Exact time: `@[<seconds>]` - Runs the dweet for exactly the specified amount of seconds. When omitted, 5 seconds is the default.
- Approximate time: `~[<seconds>]` - Runs the dweet around the specified amount of seconds, waiting for the next beat. 5 seconds is the default.
- Exact beats: `![<beats>]`- Runs the dweet for exactly the specified number of beats. 5 beats is the default.

Time warping specifiers can be:
- Beat rush: `t[<amount>]` - Rushes the time forward on beats. The amount determines how much to rush. 5 frames (5/60 seconds) is the default.
- Beat bounce: `T[<amount>]` - Bounces the time foward and then back (restores normal time) on beats. The amount determines how much to bounce. 5 frames is the default.

Trig morphing specifiers can be:
- Uniform: `u[<amount>]` - Morphs the trig functions by scaling their outputs on beats. The amount determines how much to scale. 5 is the default and it means by %50.
- Random: `r[<amount>]` - Morphs the trig functions by scaling their outputs on beats, by a random factor. The amount determines how much to scale. 5 is the default and it means by a maximum of %50 (when the random factor is 1).
- FFT: `f[<amount>]` - Morphs the trig functions by scaling their outputs by the values of the FFT bins as factors (0-1, spread over 2Ï€). The amount determines how much to scale. 5 is the default and it means by %50.

Blenders can be:
- Zoom: `z[<amount>]` - Zooms in on beats. The amount determines how much to zoom. 5 (5%) is the default.
- Vertical mirror: `v[<position>]` - Makes a flipped copy of a part of the canvas as if there's a vertical mirror. The position determines where the mirror is. 5 (50% of the screen) is the default.
- Horizontal mirror: `h[<position>]` - Makes a flipped copy of a part of the canvas as if there's a horizontal mirror. The position determines where the mirror is. 5 (50% of the screen) is the default.
- White flash: `w` - Flashes to white (#ffffff) on beats.
- Black flash: `b` - Flashes to black (#000000) on beats.
